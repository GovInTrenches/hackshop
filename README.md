# Hackshop for Civic Hackathons

This is an a fork of Rally Softwares's hackshop.waffle.io that is designed to be used for _setting up_ civic hackathons rather than participating in one. While it's useful to running hackathons in general, it's set up with civic hackathons in mind. 

The Waffle Board is based on a post I wrote about [How to Run a Civic Hackathon](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/civic-innovation-toolkit-how-to-run-a-civic-hackathon/) which you should certainly check out if you're interested in running a civic hackathon. 

The project is part of the Code for America Brigade Team's preperations for CodeAcross coming up in March of 2016. 

If you have any feedback on the board, please create an issue or email brigade-info@codeforamerica.org.
